Unreal Project Packaging, Zipping, and Uploading to S3 with a Batch Script

Overview - This batch script lets you package your unreal project with your desired settings using Unreal Engine's UAT (https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/unreal-automation-tool-for-unreal-engine/) without opening the Unreal engine itself. After packaging the script also zips the packaged files. You are free to add further functions to the script such as uploading, deleting, etc.

Prerequisites - Windows operating system and 7-Zip for the Zipping process.

How to Run - Double-click on the "pack-zip-unreal-project.bat" file.
